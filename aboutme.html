      <h1>Hi! My name is Cynthia Wu.</h1>
      <!-- <h2>Why the site exists:</h2> -->
      <p>
        I graduated from my BE in electrical engineering
        from Stony Brook University in 2022, and am now
        enrolled for the same major as a master's student
        at Columbia University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, my reasoning
        for entering into the major for my bachelor's was due to
        a combination of interest and what I felt as the 
        inaccessibility of the subject. I was able to explore
        a lot of things I probably would have never known to
        explore as an undergrad! Now, I am enrolled again for
        a similar reason, to learn the skills necessary to
        combine health and engineering in the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, learning as a student also means forgetting
        a lot as a student. I would like to collect the tips and tricks
        I've learned over my few years of learning into a place
        where I can review it occasionally, and hopefully
        someone else can benefit from it!
      </p>

        (Naturally due to copyright/legal/moral reasons 
        I will <i>not</i> be posting any class notes nor materials.
        All items on this site will be things I've thought of outside of
        class and checked and/or cited to make sure I didn't plagiarize.
        But it's not like I can just pull things out of my head!
        Stack Overflow and other sites will definitely be credited many times.)

      <h2>A mission for the future of the site:</h2>
      <p>
        I immigrated with my parents to the United States 
        at a very young age. As a child of immigrants,
        my biggest struggle has always been finding guidance.
        When I was young, I didn't know what I wanted and did not dare to
        want. I also didn't know what was out there. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Things like "engineer" or "scientist" or even "doctor" were words 
        outside of my existence. But around
        2017, when GitHub pages was exploding in popularity and 
        eduational sites like Codecademy, W3Schools, and Khan Academy 
        were exploding similarly, I started to dare to imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many ways, I see those sites as my first mentors, for giving
        me easy to access information--precious, easy-to-understand
        information that was not accessible to me otherwise. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I've tried to make portfolio sites which 
        could contain information that might be helpful to someone 
        in the same way, but ultimately I 
        was too unfocused about it. This time, I've decided to make a 
        very simple and easy to maintain site which won't have that problem.
        And hopefully when it gathers enough pages, someone else will be
        able to use the information here and dare to imagine. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (I should mention last that I am a Chinese American. At first blush,
        most people might think this 
        means growing up with expectations to be a doctor or an engineer.
        But this wasn't the case for me. My moms came here for love, and
        wanted me to grow up feeling unshackled and free from expectations. 
        Although I grew up with very little idea of what was out there, 
        I had the radical freedom to choose when I was ready,
        for which I am eternally grateful for.
        In all things, therefore, my choice is my own. But how informed those
        choices are, is based on what I know. I hope that if anyone is here
        to view the archive of tips and tricks, 
        they might obtain a little bit of what I obtained from
        Khan Academy, Codecademy, W3Schools, and all the helpful 
        eduational YouTubers.)
